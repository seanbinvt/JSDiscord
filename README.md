# JSDiscord
My personally developed DiscordJS bot. Using Commando command framework.

As I become personally interested in different topics I will add different commands. Am most proud of the "aeCommands" sub-folder which is my first project in learning Puppeteer and web scraping in headless chrome/firefox. 

3/6/2019 - May look into voice chat/reactions integration in near future.
